## Route 53

### Record Type
- **A** - map hostname to IPv4
- **AAAA** - map hostname to IPv6
- **CNAME** - map hostname to another hostname
  - the domain name must be an A or AAAA record
  - can not create for the TLD & SLD
- **NS record** -  tell the DNS resolver where to find the authoritative DNS servers for a domain
- **Alias:** points a hostname to an AWS Resource, works for non root and root
  - can be used in place of A records and AAAA records
  - native health check and free
  - can not set TTL, AWS default set

### Public vs Private Hosted Zones:
- **Public Hosted Zone:** Manages DNS records for a domain that is accessible on the public internet. For example,
  if you own example.com, you would have a public hosted zone that handles all the records for that domain.
- **Private Hosted Zone:** Used within a private network (like an Amazon VPC) to manage DNS records that are not 
  accessible on the public internet. This is useful for internal services that donâ€™t need to be exposed to the internet.

### Time To Live
- High TTL: less traffic on Route 53, but might outdated records
- Low TTL: More Traffic on Route 53 ($$) but fresh record
- Not used in Alias record

### Health Checks
- http health checks are only for public resource
- Operate at the DNS level, across global infrastructure.
- monitor an endpoint, other healthcheck, cloud watch
- **Private Hosted Zone**: we need to **create cloud watch alarm** because health check is outside the VPC

### Routing Policy
it doesnt route any traffic, it only responds to the DNS query

1. **Simple Policy**
   - can specify multiple values in the record
   - random one will be chosen
   - if Alias is enabled, then just one aws resource be specify
   - no health check
2. **Weighted Policy**
   - control the % of the traffic that go to each specific resource
   - doesnt need sum to 100
   - can have health check
   - assign weight 0 to stop sending traffic
3. **Latency Policy**
   - Redirect to the resource that has least latency
   - latency is based on traffic between user and aws region
   - can have health check
4. **Failover Policy**
   - mandatory health check
5. **Geolocation Policy**
   - based on user location
   - should have A Default record in case no match on location
   - can have health check
6. **GeoProximity**
   - You specify the locations of your resources (e.g., AWS regions, on-premises data centers).
   - Bias Adjustment:
     - You can adjust the bias for each location to either increase or decrease the portion of traffic routed to that location. 
     - Positive Bias: Expands the geographic region from which traffic is routed to the resource. 
     - Negative Bias: Shrinks the geographic region, potentially reducing traffic to that resource.
7. **IP based Routing**
8. **Multi Value**
