## Disaster Recovery

### Key Term
- **RPO(Recovery Point Objective)** : how much a **data loss** are we accept in case of disaster happened 
- **RTO(Recovery Time Objective)**: the time u can recover from a disaster

### What kind of Disaster Recovery
- On-Premise => traditional DR and very expensive
- On-Premise => AWS cloud: hybrid recovery
- AWS cloud region A => AWS cloud region B

### Disaster Recover Strategies
1. Backup and Restore: E.g snowball, snapshot (cheap)
2. Pilot Light: a small version of app (only critical component) is always running in the cloud, then auto scaling, failover
3. Warm StandBy: Full system is up but at minimal size- >scale when face disaster
4. Hot SIte / Multi Site Approach (faster RTO): full production scale is running

### DR Options
- Backup
  - EBS Snapshot, RDS auto backup/snapshot etc
  - Regular push to S3 / S3 IA /Glacier, life cycle
  - from On-Prem: snowball or storage gateway
- High Availability
  - use Route 53 migrate DNS over from region to region
  - RDS Multi AZ, ElastiCache, MultiAZ, EFS, S3
  - Site to Site VPN can be a recovery from Direct Connect
- Replication
  - RDS Replica, Aurora + Global DB
  - Database replication from on prem to RDS
  - storage Gateway

## Database Migration Service
### Overview
- Migrate Database to AWS 
- source db will remain available
- you must create an EC2(have DMS installed) to perform the replication tasks

### DMS Source and Targets

**Source**
- On-prem and EC2 instance db
- Azure
- RDS all including Aurora
- S3
- DocumentDB

**Target**
- On prem and Ec2 instance DB
- RDS
- Redshift, DynamoDB, S3
- OpenSearch
- Kinesis Data Stream
- Apache Kafka
- Redis


### Schema Conversion Tool
- Convert your Database Schema from one engine to another
- if on prem postgres -> RDS postgres , no need to use SCT

## RDS & Aurora MySQL Migrations
- RDS MySQL to Aurora MySQL
  1. DB Snapshot from RDS MySQL restored as MySQL Aurora
  2. create an Aurora Read Replica from RDS MySQL, and promote it (time take and cost)
- External MySQL to Aurora MySQL
  1. use Percona XtraBackup to create a file in S3 create Aurora from S3
  2. create an Aurora MySQL DB, use mysqldump (slower than S3)
- use DMS if both db running 


---

## On prem Strategy with AWS
- Ability to download Linux 2 AMI as a VM
- VM import/export
- Application Discovery Service: Gather info about on prem servers to plan a migration
- DMS: onprem -> AWS, AWS->onprem, AWS -> AWS

---

## AWS Backup
- centrally manage and automate backups across AWS service
- no need to create custom scripts and manual
- Supports EC2 S3, RDS, DocumentDB / Neptune EFS, FSx storage gateway
- can create a Backup Plan (E.g backup frequency, backup window, transistion to cold storage, retention period)
