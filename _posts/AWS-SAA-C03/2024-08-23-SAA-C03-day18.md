## Private and Public IP
### CIDR Limitation
- Min. Size is **/28**
- Max. size is **/16**
- an VPC can have **multiple CIDR**
- 
### Private IP
Can Only Allow Certain Values
- 10.0.0.0 / 8 <- **in Big networks**
- 172.16.0.0 / 12 <- **AWS default VPC in that range**
- 192.168.0.0 / 16 <- **home network**

VPC CIDR should NOT Overlap with other networks


## VPC
### Overview
- All new AWS account have a default VPC
- new EC2 instance are launched into default VOC if no subnet is specified
- Default VPC has internet connectivity and all ec2 instance inside have public IPv4
- we also get a public and a private IPv4 DNS name

### Create Subnet in VPC
- AWS reserves **5 IP addresses** (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet, can not be used
- If u need 29 IP address for EC2, u need choose /26 rather than /27

### Internet GateWay (IGW)
- Allows resources (e.g. EC2 instances) in a subnet , VPC . connect to the internet
- Must be created separately from a VPC (and then attach to VPC)
- One VPC -> One IGW
- Must Have Route Table to work with IGW
  1. create a route table inside a VPC
  2. add subnet associations
  3. add routes : 
     - if any traffic trying to access with in the VPC, then route them to local
     - if anything else 0.0.0./0 , route them to IGW

### Bastion Host
- use a Bastion Host to SSH into our private EC2 instances
- The bastion is in the public subnet which is then connected to all other private subnets
- Bastion Host security group must allow inbound from the internet on port 22 from restricted CIDR,
- Security Group of the EC2 Instances **must allow the Security Group of the Bastion Host**, or the **private IP of the Bastion host**

### NAT Instance (outdated)
- Allows EC2 instances in private subnets to connect to the Internet
- Must be **launched in a public subnet**
- Must disable EC2 setting: **Source / destination Check**
- Must have **Elastic IP** attached to it
- Must configure **RouteTables** to route traffic from private subnets to the NAT Instance
- It is behaving like the private ec2 instance, and send to network


### NAT Gateway
- NATGW is created in a specific **Availability Zone** ( must create multiple NAT Gateway in multiple AZs), uses an Elastic IP
- Can’t be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other subnets)
- Requires an IGW (Private Subnet => NATGW => IGW)
- No Security Groups to manage / required


---

## Security Groups & NACL 

### NACL
- firewall on subnet level, one per subnet, new subnets are assigned the Default NACL
- NACL is stateless, everytime the request pass through the NACL , it will verify (allow and deny)
- Security Group is stateful. once It's allowed to inbound, then it must allow to go out ( only allow)
- **Define NACL Rule**
  - Rules have a number (1-32766), 1 -> the highest priority
  - The last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule match
- Default NACL will accept everything, do not modify it

### Ephemeral Ports
- IANA & MS Windows10 -> 49152 – 65535
- Many Linux Kernel -> 32768 – 60999
- When you use the internet, your computer picks a temporary "door" or port (called an ephemeral port) to receive replies from websites. NACLs need rules to allow these replies to come back through these temporary doors.
- set rules to allow a range of ports that include the ephemeral ports typically used by operating systems

## VPC Peering

### Overview
- Privately connect two VPCs using AWS’ network
- Make them behave as if they were in the same network
- VPC Peering connection is **NOT transitive**
- Must not have overlapping CIDRs
- You must update route tables in **each VPC’s subnets** to ensure EC2 instances can communicate to other subnet
- You can create VPC Peering connection between VPCs in **different AWS accounts/regions**
 
## VPC Endpoint

### Overview

- VPC Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink) allows you to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of using the public Internet
- They remove the need of IGW, NATGW, to access AWS Services
- DNS Setting & RouteTables

### Types of Endpoints
- Interface Endpoints
  - Provisions an ENI (private IP address) as an entry point (must attach a Security Group)
  - Supports most AWS services
- Gateway Endpoints
  - Provisions a gateway and must be used as a target in a route table (does not use security groups)
  - Supports both S3 and DynamoDB


Interface Endpoint is preferred access is required from on- premises (Site to Site VPN or Direct Connect), a different VPC or a different region

## VPC Flow Logs
### Overview
- Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces
  - VPC Flow Logs
  - Subnet Flow Logs
  - Elastic Network Interface (ENI) Flow Logs
- Flow logs data can go to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis Data Firehose
- Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: ELB, RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift,WorkSpaces, NATGW,Transit Gateway...
- Query VPC flow logs using Athena on S3 or CloudWatch Logs Insights

### Troubleshoot SG & NACL issues (look at `action` field)
- Incoming Request
  - Inbound REJECT: **NACL** or **SG**
  - Inbound ACCEPT: Must Be **NACL Issue**
- OutGoing Requests
  - Outbound REJECT: **NACL** or **SG**
  - Outbound ACCEPT: Must Be **NACL Issue** when Inbound

## Site to SIte VPN

### Overview
- a VPN Gateway on vpc , and a Custom Gateway on corporate data center, vpn connection
- **Important step:** enable Route Propagation for theVirtual Private Gateway in the route table that is associated with your subnets

### Gateway Type
- Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
  -  VGW is created and attached to the VPC from which you want to create the Site-to-Site VPN connection
  
- Customer Gateway (CGW)
  - Software application or physical device on customer side of the VPN connection
  - Ip address
    - Public Internet-routable IP address for your Customer Gateway device
    - If it’s behind a NAT device that’s enabled for NAT traversal (NAT-T), use the public IP address of the NAT device
    

### VPN CloudHub
- Provide secure communication between multiple sites, if you have multiple VPN connections
- one Virtual Private Gateway, and connects to many customer gateways from different on prem datacenter

## Direct Connect

### Overview
- all in private Network
- AWS Direct Connect is like renting a private road that goes straight from your house, (internet congestion and slowdowns), and you can get there faster and more reliably.
-  Provides a dedicated **private** connection from a remote network to your
   VPC
- You need to setup a Virtual Private Gateway on your VPC
- Access public resources (S3) and private (EC2) on same connection
- Increase bandwidth throughput - working with large data sets – lower cost
- More consistent network experience - applications using real-time data feeds

### Direct Connect Gateway
-  you want to setup a Direct Connect to one or more VPC in many different regions (same account), you must use a Direct Connect Gateway


### Diagram of Direct Connect


---

## Transit Gateway
- we dont need to peer the VPC together 
- instead For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection
- Works with Direct Connect Gateway,VPN connections
- high throughput
- **Share Direct Connect between multiple accounts**

## Traffic Mirroring

### Overview 
- allows you to replicate network traffic from one or more source Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) to a target ENI for in-depth analysis and monitoring. 
- Traffic mirroring in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is like setting up a mirror to see a copy of the traffic that moves through your cloud network. It lets you take the data flowing through one part of your network and send a copy to another place for checking and analysis, without interrupting the original data flow. This is useful for spotting problems, checking security, and making sure everything in the network complies with rules, all without slowing down the actual traffic.
