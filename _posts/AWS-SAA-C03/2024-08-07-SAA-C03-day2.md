## EC2: configuration options
- OS: Linux, Windows, Mac OS
- compute power and cores (CPU)
- Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Storage Space
  - Network Attached (EBS & EFS)
  - hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card: speed of the card, public IP
- Firewall: Security Group
- Bootstrap script (launching commands when a machine starts): EC2 User Data
  - installing updates / installing software / downloading files /anything u can think of

## EC2: properties
- **Private IPv4 address**: visit to the instance via AWS internal private network (private VPN)
- **Key pair**: used to access instance via ssh
- **security group**: control inbound and outbound rules
- **EBS storage**:


## instance type code

### m5.2xlarge

- **m:** instance class
- **5:** generation (AWS improves them over time)
- **2xlarge:** size within the instance class


## EC2: Instance Types

- **General Purpose:** balance between compute, memory, networking
- **Compute Optimized:** require high performance
  - E.g Batch processing workloads, Media transcoding, High performance web servers, HPC, ML
- **Memory Optimized:** Fast performance that process large datasets in memory
  - E.g Databases, Distributed we cache stores, realtime processing
- **Storage Optimized:** storage-intensive tasks requires high, sequential read and write access
  - E.g OLTP, Database. Data warehousing, Distributed file system


## EC2: Security Group
- security groups only contain **allow** rules
- Regulate: ports, IP ranges, inbound traffic, outbound traffic
- security groups rules can reference by **IP** or by **security groups**
- By default All inbound traffic is **blocked**, and outbound traffic is **authorised**

### Good to know
- can be attached to multiple instances, one instance can have multiple security groups
- its a regional service / VPC service, if u change to another region or VPC, then u need recreate
- if application is time out, most likely security group issue

### ssh command & Instance Connect
- ssh -i \<path to pem> \<userName>@\<IP>
- Browser based ssh session via aws console (auto generate temp access key)
