## Load Balancer
### Overview
- Load Balancer are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (e.g EC2)
- expose **a single point of access** (DNS) to application
- health check
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
- stickiness with cookies
- separate public traffic from private traffic (point of communication)
- security group associated with load balancer

### Target Group
**Definition:** is a logical grouping of backend resources that an (ALB) or (NLB) can route traffic to

- **what is in group:**  The resources that can receive traffic (usually instances of the same service or application), which depends on type of load balancer
- **Health Checks:**  is defined at the target group level, but the actual health checks are performed on each individual target, which periodically checks the health of the targets

### Load Balancer Type
1. Application Load Balancer (http/https)
   - **Applicable Target Group**: EC2 instances, ECS tasks, Private IP addresses, or AWS Lambda functions.
   - Port Mapping Feature (for ECS)
     - **Dynamic Port Assignment:** When you launch multiple containers (like different instances of a web app), each container can be assigned a different, random port by ECS.
     - **ALB Handles Traffic:** The Application Load Balancer automatically figures out which port each container is using and sends incoming traffic to the right container on the right port.
   - the application can get client IP , port, proto from header (X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Port, X-Forwarded-Proto)
   - Routing tables to different target groups (Listener rules)
     - Routing based on path in URL (path)
     - Routing based on hostname in URL
     - Routing based in Query String Header (path variable)

2. Network Load Balancer (TCP/UDP)
   - Target Group: EC2 instances, Private IP address, Application Load Balancer
   - less latency ~ 100ms (vs 400ms for ALB)
   - One static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP

3. Gateway Load Balancer
   - Target Group: EC2 instances, Private IP address
   - used to check all incoming request by firewall before reach to application, integrate security appliances into your traffic flow with ease

### Load Balancer : Sticky Sessions (NLB & ALB)
The Problem It Solved: same client is always redirected to different instance behind a load balancer

- `cookie` is used for stickiness has an expiration date you control
- **Load Balancer-Generated Cookies:** 
  - default cookie name are `AWSALB`, `AWSELB`, `AWSNLB`,  stores information about which target the session is bound to
  - The cookie doesn't store any user data;
- **Application-Based Cookies:**
  - These cookies are created and managed by the application itself and are used to store user-specific data
  - used by the application to maintain state across multiple requests


### Load Balancer: Cross-Zone Load Balancing

- ALB is enabled by default (can be disabled at the Target Group Level)
- NLB & GLB (disabled by default, extrac cost)

### https Listeners Flow （SSL & SNI)
1. Default Certificate
   - When you create an HTTPS listener, you must specify a default SSL/TLS certificate. This certificate is used to encrypt the traffic between the client and the load balancer.
   - The default certificate is used when the client does not provide a Server Name Indication (SNI) or if there is no matching certificate for the domain the client is trying to reach.
2. Multiple Certificates (SNI Support):
   - Clients can use SNI to specify the hostname they are trying to reach. The load balancer then selects the appropriate certificate from the list to handle the request.


### Connection Draining (Registration Delay)
- Time to complete “in-flight requests” while the instance is de-registering or unhealthy
- Stops sending new requests to the EC2 instance which is de-registering
- Between 1 and 3600 seconds (default: 300 seconds)
- Can be disabled (set value to 0)
- Set to a low value if your requests are short

## Auto Scaling Group

### Overview
- health check on asg level
- A launch Template (AMI, instance type, User Data, Network, Role, Load Balancer info .etc)
- MinSize/ MaxSize/ Initial Capacity
- Scaling Policy
- if use with ELB, usually register the ASG to a target group

### Scaling Policy
scale an ASG based on metric, alarms to scale in & scale out.
- Dynamic Scaling
  - Target Tracking: want CPU around 40
  - Step Scaling: example(CPU > 70) then add
- Schedule Scaling
  - add to 10 when  7am
- Predictive scaling: continuously forecast and schedule scaling ahead
- scaling cooldown period (default 300): during cooldown, ASG will not launch or terminate
