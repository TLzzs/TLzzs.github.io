## Standard SQS And FIFO SQS
### Overview
  - Default retention of message: 4 days, maximum 14 days
  - Each Message has a limit of 256KB
  - Message is persisted in sqs until a consumer deletes it
  - **Standard SQS:** Out of order message, and can have duplicate messages. / Unlimited Throughput and Unlimited Number of Messages
  - **FIFO SQS:** Message are inorder if they have same group id. / Limit throughput 300 msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with

### Sample Use Case
- **SQS With Auto Scaling Group**

- **SQS with decoupling**

### Security
  - **IAM** regulates who can create, view, and delete queues, as well as send and receive messages.
  - **SQS access Policies:** control access to the queue from different AWS accounts or via specific conditions such as VPC endpoint, IP address, or User-Agent.
  - **Private Connectivity:** if your consumers and producers are within a VPC, you can use VPC endpoints to allow direct access to SQS without 
  needing to traverse the public internet. (Need config Endpoint Policies further restrict which VPC and which user/role can access the queue.)

    
### SQS Message Visibility Timeout
  - Definition: how long a message remains **invisible** to other consumers after it has been retrieved by a consumer.
  - Default time is **30** secs, Consumer could call **ChangeMessageVisibility**
  - If set too high, and consumer crashes , reprocessing take time
  - If set too low, may get duplicates

### SQS Long Polling
  - When a consumer requests message from the queue it can wait for message to arrive （Long Polling）
  - Decrease the number of API calls (cost-effective)
  - Wait time can be between（1 - 20 sec）

## SNS 
### Overview
  - Send one message to **SNS Topic**, Publish messages to subscribers (up to 12.5 million per topic, up to 100k topics)
  - The Subscribers can be（**SQS / Lambda / Kinesis DataFirehose / Emails / SMS / Http(s) Endpoint**)
  - Lots of services can send data directly to SNS Topic
  - **SNS FIFO**: 
    - all messages in the same group are ordered / same throughput as SQS FIFO 
    - Can have SQS Standard and FIFO queues as subscribers , but better FIFO queue

### SNS Publish Ways
1. **Topic Publish :** publishing messages to an SNS topic to which multiple subscribers can listen.
2. **Direct Publish (Mobile Push):**  ending messages directly to a mobile endpoint or to a mobile app installed on a 
   user’s device via platforms like Apple APNS (Apple Push Notification Service), Google GCM (Google Cloud Messaging), or 
   Amazon ADM (Amazon Device Messaging).

### Security
- **IAM** regulates who can create, view, and delete topic, as well as send and receive messages.
- **SQS access Policies:** control access to the topic from different AWS accounts or via specific conditions such as VPC endpoint, IP address, or User-Agent.
- **Private Connectivity:** Using VPC Endpoints for SNS, you can securely publish messages to SNS topics from within a 
  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without exposing the traffic to the public internet.


### SNS Integration
  1. SNS + SQS FanOUT (Make sure your SQS queue access policy allows for SNS to write)

  2. S3 Events to multiple queues

  3. SNS to Amazon S3 through Kinesis Data Firehose

### SNS Message Filtering
  - JSON policy used to filter messages sent to SNS topic’s subscriptions
  - If a subscription doesn’t have a filter policy, it receives every message

## Kinesis
### Overview
Make it easy to **collect, process, and analyze** streaming data in real-time
- **Kinesis Data Streams:** Kinesis Data Streams is primarily used to ingest and store large volumes of real-time data from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, IoT devices, and logs.
- **Kinesis Data Firehose:** load data streams into AWS data stores
- **Kinesis Data Analytics:** analyze data streams with SQL or Apache Flink

---

### Kinesis Data Stream
- Producer send to data stream,  will have partition key (decide which shard the data goes)
- Retention between 1 day to 365 days ( can reprocess data )
- Once Data is inserted in Kinesis, it cant be deleted 
- Consumer (Kinesis Client Library -> build application that consuming / Managed AWS Service, **Lambda, KDF, KDA**)
- Capacity Modes
  - Provisioned mode: choose the number of shards provisioned, scale manually or using API
  - On-demand mode: No need to provision or manage the capacity

### Kinesis Data Stream Security
- Use (IAM) to control who can create, access, and manage your Kinesis streams.
- **Kinesis Stream Policies:** can specify who can access the stream and the actions they are allowed to perform, 
  which can include permissions for other AWS accounts or IAM roles.
- Monitor API calls using CloudTrail

### Kinesis Data Firehose
- Firehose allows you to transform the data before delivering it to the destination. 
- Or you can use AWS Lambda to apply more complex transformations.
- Supports custom data transformations using AWS Lambda
- can send failed or all data to a backup S3 bucket

Destination could be
1. AWS: RedShift / S3 / OpenSearch
2. 3rd Party partner: Splunk Mongo DB
3. Custom Http endpoint

### Kinesis Firehose vs Kinesis Data stream
- Kinesis Data Streams: Think of it as a real-time messaging system where you want consumers to process data actively, similar to Kafka.
- Kinesis Data Firehose: Think of it as a managed service to move data from producers to destinations with optional transformation, but without the need for complex consumer logic. It’s more of a data transport and delivery mechanism.

### Data Ordering for Kinesis and SQS FIFO
- FIFO within a Shard: Yes, records are FIFO within a shard. If two records are sent to the same shard, they will be consumed by the consumers in the same order they were added.
- Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queues, if you have only one consumer, the messages will be processed in the exact order they were sent.
