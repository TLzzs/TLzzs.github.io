## AWS KMS

### Overview
- AWS manages encryption keys for us
- Fully integrated with IAM for authorization
- Able to audit KMS Key usage using **CloudTrail**
- KMS Key Encryption also available through API calls (SDK, CLI)
- Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables

### Symmetric Key And Asymmetric Key
- Symmetric Key (u will not get unencrypted KMS key in this case, only API call)
- Asymmetric Key (public key is encrypt, private decrypt pair)
  - use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who cant call KMS API

### Type of KMS Key
1. AWS Owned Keys (free): SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB (rotation 1 year)
2. AWS Managed Key: free (aws/service-name, example: aws/rds or aws/ebs) 
3. customer managed key created in KMS 1$ / month (must be enabled) automatic & on-demand
4. customer managed key imported: 1$ / month (only manual rotation possible using alias)
4. pay for API call to KMS

### KMS Key Policy
- control access to KMS Keys
- but if u dont have key policy , u dont have access to KMS
- **Default Key Policy**
  - created if dont provide a specific KMS Key Policy
  - complete access to the root user
- **Custom KMS Key Policy**
  - Define user roles that can access the KMS key
  - define who can administer the key
- **Custom KMS Key Use Case** : Copying Snapshot across accounts
  1. create a snapshot, encrypted with own KMS key
  2. attach KMS key policy to authorize cross-account access
  3. shared the encrypted snapshot
  4. in target account, create a copy of the snapshot, encrypted with a CMK

### Multi Region Keys
- replicate the Key into other region (exactly same copy)
- but it will managed independently
- Use case: global client-side encryption, encryption on Global DynamoDB, Global Aurora

### S3 Replication Encryption Consideration
- if we use SSE-S3, the replication happened by default
- if encrypted with SSE-C, we need to enable the option
  - Specify which KMS Key to encrypt the objects within the target bucket
  - An IAM Role with kms:Decrypt for the source KMS Key and kms:Encrypt for the target KMS Key


### AMI Sharing Process (Encrypted via KMS)

1. **AMI Encryption in Source Account:**
  - The AMI in the source account (Account A) is encrypted with a KMS key from the source account.
2. **Modify Image Attribute:**
  - Modify the image attribute to add a Launch Permission, which corresponds to the specified target AWS account (Account B).
3. **Share KMS Keys:**
  - Share the KMS keys used to encrypt the snapshot that the AMI references with the target account (Account B) or an IAM Role in that account.
4. **Permissions in Target Account:**
  - The IAM Role/User in the target account (Account B) must have the following permissions:
    - `kms:DescribeKey`
    - `kms:ReEncrypt`
    - `kms:CreateGrant`
    - `kms:Decrypt`
5. **Launching EC2 Instance:**
  - When launching an EC2 instance from the AMI, the target account (Account B) can optionally specify a new KMS key in its own account to re-encrypt the volumes.

## SSM Parameter Store

### Parameter Policies
- Allow to assign a TTL to a parameter (expiration date) to force updating or deleting sensitive data such as passwords
- Can assign multiple policies at a time


---

## Secret Manager

### Overview
- Newer service, meant for storing secret
- **Force rotation of secrets** every X days
- Automate generation of secrets on rotation (use Lambda)
- Integrate with RDS (mostly)
- Secret are encrypted using KMS

### Multi region secrets
- Replicate Secrets across multiple AWS Region
- Secrets Manager keeps read replica in sync

---

## AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
-  Easily provision, manage, and deploy TLS Certificates
- Provide in-flight encryption for websites (HTTPS)
- Integrations with (loadTLS certificates on) 
  - ElasticLoadBalancers(CLB,ALB,NLB)
  - CloudFront Distributions 
  - APIs on API Gateway
- Cannot use ACM with EC2


### Requesting public certificates
creating and verifying SSL/TLS certificates that identify and secure communication for resources on the internet.

1. Ask for a Certificate: You tell AWS which website name needs a certificate.
2. Prove It's Yours: AWS asks you to show that you own the website.
3. Get the Certificate: Once AWS knows you own the site, they give you the certificate.
4. Use It: You set up the certificate on your website to make it secure.

## AWS WAF

### Overview
- Protects your web applications from common web exploits
- Can Apply on **Application Load Balancer, API Gateway, CloudFront, AppSync GraphQL API, Cognito User Pool**
- **Define Web ACL**
  - **IP Set Rule:** Allows you to specify up to 10,000 IP addresses or IP ranges.
  - **HTTP Headers, HTTP Body, or URI Strings:** For instance, you can block requests containing malicious SQL code or scripts that are indicative of XSS attacks.
  - **Size Constraints**: based on the length of parts of the request, such as the query string, URI, or the size of the request body.
  - **Geo-Match (Block Countries):** Allows blocking or allowing requests based on the geographic location of the request origin.
  - **Rate-Based Rules:** If requests from a particular client exceed a defined threshold, AWS WAF can trigger a rule that blocks further requests from that IP address for a set duration. （DDoS）
- Web ACL are Regional except for CloudFront
- A rule group is a reusable set of rules that you can add to a web ACL

### Fixed IP while using WAF with a Load Balancer
- AWS WAF does not support integration with Network Load Balancers (NLB) because NLBs operate at Layer 4
- Using AWS Global Accelerator with ALB: To achieve a configuration that utilizes fixed IP addresses while also leveraging AWS WAF, you can use AWS Global Accelerator in conjunction with an Application Load Balancer (ALB). AWS Global Accelerator provides static IP addresses that serve as a fixed entry point to your applications hosted on AWS and routes traffic to optimal endpoints, such as ALBs.

## AWS Shield： protect from DDoS attack
- AWS Shield Standard （free enabld by default）
  - Provides protection from attacks such as SYN/UDP Floods,
- AWS Shield Advanced:
  - Protect against more sophisticated attack on Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Route 53
  - 24/7 access to AWS DDoS response team (DRP)
  - Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation automatically creates, evaluates and deploys AWS WAF rules to mitigate layer 7 attacks


---

## Firewall Manager
### Overview 
- Manage rules in all accounts of an AWS Organization
- Security policy: common set of security rules
  - WAF rules (Application Load Balancer, API Gateways, CloudFront)
  - AWS Shield Advanced (ALB, CLB, NLB, Elastic IP, CloudFront)
  - Security Groups for EC2, Application Load Balancer and ENI resources in VPC
  - AWS Network Firewall (VPC Level)
- Rules are applied to new resources as they are created (good for compliance) across all and future accounts in your Organization
