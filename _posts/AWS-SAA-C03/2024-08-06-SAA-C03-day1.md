## IAM: User And Groups
- IAM = identity and access management, **Global Service**
- **Users** are people in organization, can be grouped (Best practice)
- **Groups** only contain user, not other group
- A user can belong to any number of groups (**incl 0**)

## IAM: Permissions
- **Users** or **Groups** can be assigned JSON documents called **policies** (define the permissions of the users)
- **Least Privilege Principle**: dont give more permissions than a user needs
- Users can **inherit** the permission policies from the group
- **Inline Policy** is depending on the role, user and group, it cant exist by itself

## IAM: Policy Structure


## IAM: Multi Factor Authentication - MFA
- Password Policy : password strength, password rotation
- **MFA = password you know + security device you own** : even password is stolen, the account is not compromised


## 3 Ways to Access AWS
1. **AWS Management Console** (protected by password + MFA)
2. **AWS Command Line Interface**: protected by access keys 
   - Access key are generated through AWS Console
   - Access Key ID = username, Secret Access Key = password
   - using the `aws config` to config ur detail
   - **Alternatively using Cloud Shell (Regional Service)** 
3. **AWS SDK** - embedded with application code: protected by access keys


## IAM Roles for Services
- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- We will assign permissions to AWS services with **IAM Roles**
- Common Roles :
  - EC2 instance role
  - Lambda Function Roles
  - Roles for CloudFormation

## IAM: Security Tools
- **IAM Credentials Report** (account level): a report that lists all account's user and the status of their credentials
- **IAM Access Advisor** (User Level): shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those service were accessed


## Best Practise IAM
- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One Physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a **strong password policy**
- Use and enforce the use of **MFA**
- Create and use **Roles** for giving **permissions** to AWS services
- Use **Access Keys** for Programmatic Access (CLI/SDK)
- Audit permissions of account using **IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor**
