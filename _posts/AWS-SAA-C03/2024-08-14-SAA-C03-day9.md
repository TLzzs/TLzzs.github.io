### 4 Object Encryption
1. server-side with SSE-S3 (enable by default) Header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
2. server-side with SSE-KMS "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms" the key S3 gonna use is form KMS
3. serverside with customer provided key SSE-C, upload file along with key (HTTPS must)
4. Client side encryption
- Bucket Policy can use aws:SecureTransport to force use https

### CORS
- Origin = protocol + domain + port
- CORS is like a security guard for web browsers. It controls who can access resources (like data, images, or APIs) on one website from another website
- Use case: Imagine you have a website hosted on www.mywebsite.com, 
  and you want to load images or access data stored in an S3 bucket (e.g., my-bucket) from this website. By default, the browserâ€™s security policy restricts this cross-origin access. To allow this, you need to configure CORS on the S3 bucket.


### MFA Delete
- will be required if u want
  - permanently delete an object version
  - suspend versioning on bucket
- To use MFA Delete , versioning must be enabled
- only root user can enable/disable MFA delete


### Access Log
- Any request made to S3 from any account authorized or denied will be logged in to another S3
- target logging bucket must be in the same AWS region
- used for analysis


### presigned URLs
- can be generated using S3 console, CLi or SDK
- Expiration
  - Console : 1 min - 12 hours
  - AWS CLI : 3600 secs -  168 hours

### Glacier Vault Lock and Object Lock
- Glacier Vault Lock is a feature in Amazon S3 Glacier that allows you to enforce compliance controls on a Glacier vault by locking its policy. Once the Vault Lock policy is in place and locked, it cannot be changed or deleted, making it useful for compliance with data retention regulations.
- S3 Object Lock provides similar immutability guarantees (need enable versioning) but at the object level in S3, rather than at the vault level in Glacier. It allows you to store objects using a Write Once, Read Many (WORM) model, which can prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a specified period or indefinitely.
    - Retention Mode: Compliance : no one can change
    - Retention Mode: Governace: some user have permission can modify
    - LegalHold: protect 

### Access Point 
- With access points, you can create multiple entry points to a single S3 bucket, each with its own access policy. This allows you to tailor access permissions for different users, applications, or services, without modifying the bucket's main policy.
- Each access point can have its own resource-based policy, which defines who can access the data through that access point and what actions they can perform. This provides fine-grained control over how data is accessed and by whom.
- each access point has own DNS
- through VPC, we need to have VPC Endpoint(gateway or interface endpoint) connect to access point. and must have access to target bucket and accesspoint



### Object Lambda 
- With S3 Object Lambda, you can add custom code to modify the data returned by S3 GET requests, so that you can filter, transform, or otherwise manipulate the data before it is returned to the requester, without having to store multiple versions of the object in your bucket.

#### 1. S3 Object Lambda Flow

- **Objective:** Dynamically transform data during GET requests using a Lambda function, without altering the original object in S3.

- **Flow:**
  1. **Client Request:** The application sends a GET request to an **S3 Object Lambda Access Point**.
  2. **Object Lambda Access Point:** The request is intercepted by the Object Lambda Access Point, which is configured to invoke a specific **Lambda function**.
  3. **Lambda Function:**
    - Retrieves the original object from the S3 bucket.
    - Processes or transforms the data as defined in the function's logic.
  4. **Response:** The processed data is returned to the Object Lambda Access Point, which then sends it back to the application.

- **Use Case:** Ideal for scenarios where you need to serve dynamically transformed or customized content directly from S3, without storing multiple versions of the data.

#### 2. Direct Lambda-to-S3 Interaction Flow

- **Objective:** Use a Lambda function to directly interact with S3 for data processing, triggered by various events or API requests.

- **Flow:**
  1. **Trigger:** The Lambda function is triggered by an event (such as an S3 upload, API Gateway request, etc.).
  2. **Lambda Function:**
    - Uses the AWS SDK to directly interact with S3.
    - Retrieves the object from the S3 bucket.
    - Processes or transforms the data based on the function's logic.
  3. **Outcome:**
    - The processed data can be returned to the triggering service (e.g., an API response).
    - Alternatively, the processed data can be stored back in S3 or forwarded to another service.

- **Use Case:** Best for event-driven processing, custom APIs, or when you want direct control over interactions with S3, without the need for real-time transformations at the point of data access.
