## EC2 Instance Storage: EBS
### Overview
- Allows instance to **persist data** even after termination
- Only can be mounted to one instance at a time
- Specific to **one** AZ (To move a volume across, first need to snapshot)
- Delete On Termination Attribute: controls EBS behavior when EC2 terminates
  - By default: root EBS volume is deleted
  - By default: any other attached EBS volume is not deleted

### EBS Snapshot
- recommend to detach the volume and do the backup , but dont need to
- create snapshot from the volume and restore it in another AZ/region

### EBS SnapShot feature
- EBS Snapshot archive
  - move a snapshot to archive tire, cheaper
  - takes 24 - 72 hours for restoring
- Recycle Bin for EBS snapshot
  - setup rules to retain deleted snapshot so u can recover after an accidental deletion
  - specify retention period (1 day to 1 year)

### EBS Encryption
- Encrypted EBS means: 
  - Data at rest is encrypted
  - data in the flight moving between instance and volume is encrypted
  - all snapshot are encrypted
  - volume created via snapshot are encrypted
- Step of EBS Encryption : 
  1. create an EBS snapshot
  2. encrypt the snapshot
  3. create new EBS from the encrypted snapshot
  4. attach the newly created volume to the instance

### EBS Volume Type
- **gp2/gp3(SSD):** balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
- **io1/io2 (SSD):** Highest performance SSD volume for mission critical low latency or high throughput workloads
  - Best for I/O-intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases
- **st1 (HDD):** low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed , throughput=intensive workloads
  - Ideal for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads such as big data, data warehouses, and log processing.
- **sc1 (HDD):** Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workload
  -  Suitable for less frequently accessed workloads such as colder data requiring fewer scans per day
- only SSD can be used as boot volume (running OS)

### EBS MultiAttach
- Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instance **in the same AZ**
- Only suitable for **io1/io2**
- up to 16 ec2

## EC2: AMI
### Overview
- customization of an EC2 instance
  - add ur own software, configuration , os,
  - faster boot / configuration time, because all your software is pre-package
- AMI are build for specific region (but can be copied across region)

### Step To Build An AMI
1. start an EC2 instance and customize
2. stop instance (for data integrity)
3. build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshot
4. launch instance from other AMIs

## EC2 Instance Store
- EBS has limited performance
- EC2 Instance Store: better I/O performance
- However, ec2 instance store lose their storage if they stop

---

## EC2: EFS
### Overview
- can be mounted on many EC2 (many instance connect to the fie system)
- EC2 in multiple AZ can access same EFS, Multiple region can't
- set up a security group for a mount target ( allow inbound access for the TCP protocol on the NFS port from all EC2 instances on which you want to mount the file system )
- scale automatically

### EFS storage class tier (life policy feature - move file to tier after N days)
- standard: frequently accessed file
- infrequent access: cost to retrieve files, low price to store
- archive: rarely accessed data (few times each year)

### File System Configuration
- File System Type: **Regional** & **One Zone**
- **Life Cycle Management** : Transition into EFS-IA, Transition into Archive, Transition into Standard if they access
- **Throughput Mode:** 
  1. **Elastic:** unpredictable I/O
  2. **Provisioned:** You know the target throughput
  3. **Bursting:** will give you more throughput based on your storage
- **Security Group:** associated with an Amazon EFS mount target controls the traffic between EC2 instances and the EFS file system.
