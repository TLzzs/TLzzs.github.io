## Lambda
### Overview
- Virtual Functions - no server to manage
- Limited by time (15 minutes)
- On demand
- Scaling is automated!

### Main Services Lambda to integrate
- **API Gateway:** AWS Lambda can be triggered by API Gateway to handle HTTP requests, enabling serverless web applications or APIs.
- **Kinesis:** AWS Lambda processes real-time streaming data from Kinesis streams, performing actions like data transformations or analytics.
- **DynamoDB:** AWS Lambda functions can be triggered by DynamoDB Streams to process item-level changes in a DynamoDB table.
- **S3:** AWS Lambda can automatically respond to events in S3, such as when a file is uploaded or deleted from a bucket.
- **CloudFront:** AWS Lambda@Edge runs Lambda functions closer to users, enabling dynamic content manipulation at CloudFront edge locations.
- **EventBridge:** AWS Lambda can be invoked by Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) in response to events from various AWS services or custom applications.
- **CloudWatch Logs:** AWS Lambda logs execution details and custom logging information to CloudWatch Logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **SNS:** AWS Lambda can be triggered by SNS to process messages published to topics, enabling event-driven architectures.
- **SQS:** AWS Lambda can process messages from SQS queues, handling tasks like job processing or data buffering.
- **Cognito:** AWS Lambda can be used to customize authentication and authorization workflows in Amazon Cognito, such as pre-signup and post-authentication triggers.

### Lambda S3 Thumbnail creation

### AWS Lambda Limit - per region
- Memory Allocation: 128 mb - 10 GB
- maximum execution time 15 minutes
- env variable (4kb)
- Disk capacity in the container 512mb - 10gb
- concurrent execution 1000 (can be increased)
- function < 50 mb

### Lambda SnapStart
- improve functions performance up to 10x
- hot start
- when publish a new version
  - Lambda initializes your function
  - Takes a snapshot of memory and disk state of the initialized function
  - Snapshot is cached for low-latency access


### Customization at the edge
Both **CloudFront Functions** and **Lambda@Edge** can be used to modify CloudFront requests and responses

Used to change CloudFront requests and responses:
- Viewer Request – after CloudFront receives a request from a viewer
- Origin Request – before CloudFront forwards the request to the origin
- Origin Response – after CloudFront receives the response from the origin
- Viewer Response – before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer

### Network of Lambda (to connect resource in own VPC)
- you must define the VPC ID , subnets and Security Groups
- Lambda will create an ENI in subnets to communicate resources


### Lambda With RDS Proxy
- RDS proxy in private subnet connect to RDS, and Lambda must deploy in your VPC, RDS proxy never public
- Improve scalability by pooling and sharing DB connection
- Failover
- Can enable IAM authentication


### invoking Lambda From RDS & Aurora
- Allows you to process data event from within a database
- Supported for **RDS for Postgres** and **Aurora MySQL**
- Must allow outbound traffic to your lambda function with in your DB instance
- DB instance must have the required permissions to invoke the Lambda function

## API Gateway
### Overview
- Lambda + API Gateway -> No infra manage
- handle security (Authorization and Authentication)
- handle different version of API
- Transform and validate the request and response
- cache api response


### Integration
- **Invoke Lambda Function:**
  - **Easy way to expose REST API backed by AWS Lambda.**
  - **HTTP:** Use HTTP to invoke Lambda functions via exposed endpoints.
  - **Expose HTTP Endpoints:** Allows you to expose HTTP endpoints in the backend.
    - **Example:** Internal HTTP API on-premises, Application Load Balancer.
    - **Why?** Add rate limiting, caching, user authentication, API keys, etc.

- **AWS Service Integration:**
  - **Expose any AWS API through the API Gateway.**
    - **Example:** Start an AWS Step Function workflow, post a message to SQS.
    - **Why?** Add authentication, deploy publicly, rate control, etc.

### API Gateway Deployment Options

- **Edge-Optimized (Default):**
  - **For Global Clients:** Designed for clients distributed across the globe.
  - **CloudFront Integration:** Requests are routed through CloudFront Edge locations, which improves latency.
  - **Single Region:** The API Gateway is still hosted in only one AWS region.

- **Regional:**
  - **For Local Clients:** Best suited for clients within the same region as the API Gateway.
  - **Manual CloudFront Integration:** You can manually combine with CloudFront, giving you more control over caching strategies and distribution.

- **Private:**
  - **VPC Access Only:** Can only be accessed from within your VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI).
  - **Access Control:** Use a resource policy to define and restrict access to the API.



### API Gateway – Security

- **User Authentication:**
  - **IAM Roles:** Useful for internal applications to authenticate users via AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
  - **Cognito:** Use Amazon Cognito for identity management for external users, such as mobile users.
  - **Custom Authorizer:** Implement your own logic for user authentication using Lambda functions.

- **Custom Domain Name & HTTPS Security:**
  - **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Integration:** Secure your API with HTTPS by integrating with ACM.
  - **Edge-Optimized Endpoint:** The SSL certificate must be in the `us-east-1` region.
  - **Regional Endpoint:** The SSL certificate must be in the same region as the API Gateway.
  - **DNS Setup:** You must set up a CNAME or A-alias record in Route 53 to point your custom domain to the API Gateway.

---
## Step Function
### Overview
coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows, allowing you to build complex applications by linking together individual AWS Lambda functions or other AWS services into a series of steps.

- workflows are represented as state machines. Each state can be a task, choice (conditional branching), wait (delays), or parallel state.
- Step Functions can be triggered on a schedule using Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events), which allows you to run workflows at regular intervals, similar to cron jobs.
- Ideal for serverless applications, data processing pipelines, ETL jobs, microservices orchestration, and any workflow requiring integration with AWS services.

### AWS Cognito Overview

- **Give Users an Identity:**
  - Provide users with an identity to interact with your web or mobile application.

- **Cognito User Pools:**
  - **Sign-In Functionality:** Provides sign-in functionality for your app users.
  - **Integration:** Can be integrated with API Gateway & Application Load Balancer to manage user authentication.

- **Cognito Identity Pools (Federated Identity):**
  - **AWS Credentials:** Provide AWS credentials to users, enabling them to access AWS resources directly.
  - **Identity Provider:** Can integrate with Cognito User Pools as an identity provider to federate identities.

#### **Cognito vs IAM**

- **Cognito:**
  - Best for scenarios with "hundreds of users."
  - Ideal for "mobile users" who need to authenticate via the app.
  - Supports authentication with external identity providers (like "SAML," social logins, etc.).

- **IAM:**
  - Typically used for managing AWS accounts and permissions for "internal users" (like employees or system administrators).
  - Not designed for handling large numbers of external users or mobile user authentication.

#### Integrating Cognito User Pools with API Gateway

1. **Create a Cognito User Pool:**
    - Set up a Cognito User Pool to manage user sign-up, sign-in, and authentication.

2. **Configure API Gateway:**
    - Go to API Gateway and select your API.
    - For each method (e.g., GET, POST), set the **Authorization** type to **Cognito User Pool**.

3. **Associate API Gateway with Cognito User Pool:**
    - Specify the Cognito User Pool that will be used to authenticate users.

4. **Token Validation:**
    - API Gateway will automatically validate the JWT token included in the `Authorization` header of incoming requests.

5. **Invoke the API:**
    - Users log in through Cognito to obtain a JWT token.
    - Include the JWT token in the API request headers to access the API securely.

#### Integrating Cognito User Pools with Application Load Balancer (ALB)

1. **Create a Cognito User Pool:**
    - Set up a Cognito User Pool to manage your application's users.

2. **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
    - Set up an ALB in the AWS Management Console.

3. **Configure ALB Listener:**
    - Add a listener to your ALB (usually on port 443 for HTTPS).
    - Add a listener rule to redirect traffic for authentication using the Cognito User Pool.

4. **Set Up Authentication Action:**
    - Configure the ALB to authenticate users via the Cognito User Pool.
    - Users are redirected to the Cognito-hosted sign-in page or a custom sign-in page.

5. **Token Validation:**
    - After successful authentication, Cognito issues a JWT token.
    - ALB validates this token on subsequent requests.

6. **Routing Traffic:**
    - Once authenticated, the ALB routes traffic to the appropriate target (e.g., EC2 instances, ECS services).
