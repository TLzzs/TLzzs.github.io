### AWS CloudFront
- improve read performance , content is cached at the edge
- DDoS Protection and integrate with Shield , and WAF

#### Origins
- S3 Bucket:
  - for distributing files and caching them at edge
  - enhance security with OAC
    - OAC is used to ensure that only CloudFront can access your S3 bucket. This helps prevent direct access to your bucket from the internet, which can expose your content to unauthorized users.
  - cloudfront can be used as an ingress(upload file to S3)
- Custom Origin (HTTP) : **Must Be Public and security group must allow edge location**
  - Application Load Balancer
  - EC2 
  - S3 website
  - or any HTTP backend

#### Geo Restriction
- Can restrict who can access your distribution (WAF)
  - allowlist / blocklist

#### Cache Invalidations
- CloudFront will not know the latest update after TTL has expired
- however you can force an entire or partial cache refresh bypassing CloudFront Invalidation
1. Invalidation Request: You create an invalidation request in the CloudFront management console or via the AWS CLI/API. The request specifies which cached objects should be invalidated.
2. Wildcard Invalidation: You can invalidate specific files or use wildcard paths (e.g., /images/*) to invalidate multiple files at once.
3. Propagation: CloudFront then propagates the invalidation request to all its edge locations worldwide. The specified content is removed from the cache at each edge location.

### Unicast IP vs Anycast IP
- Unicast IP: one server holds one IP
- Anycast IP: all server holds one IP, the client is routed to the nearest one

### Global Accelerator
- Use case : an application and have global users who want to access it directly but it will have a lot latency
- 2 Anycast IP are created for application,  the Anycast IP send traffic directly to Edge Location
- works with Elastic IP, EC2, ALB, NLB, public or private
- Health check, good Performance, security


### Key Differences Between CloudFront and Global Accelerator

#### Content Delivery vs. Network Performance

- **CloudFront** is focused on delivering and caching content closer to users.
- **Global Accelerator** is focused on improving the performance and availability of entire applications by optimizing network routing.

#### Caching

- **CloudFront** caches content at edge locations.
- **Global Accelerator** does not cache content; it optimizes the routing of network traffic to the best performing endpoints.

#### Use with Dynamic Content

- **CloudFront** can accelerate dynamic content delivery by caching parts of the response.
- **Global Accelerator** is better suited for applications where you need to optimize network paths to reduce latency or distribute traffic between regions.

#### Traffic Control

- **Global Accelerator** allows you to manage traffic across multiple AWS regions and endpoints, making it ideal for global failover and traffic shaping.
- **CloudFront** primarily manages how and where content is cached and delivered.


### Security Features of CloudFront and Global Accelerator

#### CloudFront

1. **DDoS Protection**:
  - Integrated with AWS Shield to provide protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
  - AWS Shield Standard is automatically included, and AWS Shield Advanced can be enabled for additional protection and support.

2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
  - AWS WAF can be deployed with CloudFront to protect against common web exploits, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
  - Customizable rules to filter out malicious traffic before it reaches your application.

3. **Encryption**:
  - Supports SSL/TLS encryption for secure content delivery.
  - Enforces HTTPS between CloudFront and viewers, and between CloudFront and the origin.
  - Supports AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption of sensitive data.

4. **Access Control**:
  - **Origin Access Control (OAC)**: Ensures that only CloudFront can access your Amazon S3 bucket, improving security.
  - **Signed URLs and Cookies**: Provides fine-grained access control to your content, allowing you to restrict access to certain users or time frames.

5. **Compliance**:
  - CloudFront is compliant with various security and data protection standards, including PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.
  - Detailed logs and integration with AWS CloudTrail for monitoring and auditing access to content.

#### Global Accelerator

1. **DDoS Protection**:
  - Integrated with AWS Shield to protect against DDoS attacks, similar to CloudFront.
  - AWS Shield Standard is included by default, and AWS Shield Advanced can be enabled for enhanced protection.

2. **Static IP Addresses**:
  - Global Accelerator provides two static IP addresses that can be used to route traffic to your application endpoints, reducing the attack surface by eliminating the need to expose multiple IP addresses.

3. **Endpoint Health Monitoring**:
  - Continuously monitors the health of your application endpoints and automatically redirects traffic to healthy endpoints, ensuring availability and minimizing the impact of attacks.

4. **Traffic Control**:
  - Allows you to configure traffic distribution across multiple AWS regions, enabling failover and disaster recovery strategies, which contribute to overall application security.

5. **Compliance**:
  - Global Accelerator also adheres to AWSâ€™s security standards and is compliant with various industry regulations.
  - Integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure management of resources and access controls.
