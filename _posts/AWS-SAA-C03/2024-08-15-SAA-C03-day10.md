## AWS CloudFront

### Overview
- improve read performance , content is cached at the edge
- **DDoS** Protection and integrate with **Shield** , and **WAF**
- Improves users experience

### Origins
- **S3 Bucket:**
  - for distributing files and caching them at edge
  - enhance security with **OAC** and **Bucket Policy**
    - OAC is used to ensure that only CloudFront can access your S3 bucket. This helps prevent direct access to your bucket from the internet, which can expose your content to unauthorized users.
  - cloudfront can be used as an ingress(upload file to S3)
- **Custom Origin (HTTP)** : **Must Be Public and security group must allow edge location**
  - Application Load Balancer
  - EC2 
  - S3 website
  - or any HTTP backend

### S3 Cross Region Replication vs Cloudfront
| Feature/Aspect                  | CloudFront                                        | S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)                  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**             | Content delivery with low latency                | Data replication across regions                    |
| **Data Storage**                | Caches content at edge locations temporarily     | Replicates data to another S3 bucket permanently   |
| **Latency Reduction**           | Yes, by serving content from the nearest edge location | No, focuses on data availability, not latency      |
| **Use Case Examples**           | Website acceleration, video streaming, API distribution | Disaster recovery, compliance, global data sharing |
| **Replication Scope**           | Temporary caching at global edge locations       | Permanent replication to another S3 bucket in a different region |
| **Integration**                 | Integrates with various AWS services, supports custom origins | Works specifically with S3 buckets            |
| **Security Features**           | DDoS protection, SSL/TLS, geographic restrictions | Maintains S3 encryption and access policies        |

### Geo Restriction
- Can restrict who can access your distribution (WAF): **allowlist / blocklist**

### Cache Invalidations
- CloudFront will not know the latest update after TTL has expired
- however you can force an entire or partial cache refresh bypassing CloudFront Invalidation

**Steps:**
1. **Invalidation Request:** You create an invalidation request in the CloudFront management console or via the AWS CLI/API. The request specifies which cached objects should be invalidated.
2. **Wildcard Invalidation:** You can invalidate specific files or use wildcard paths (e.g., /images/*) to invalidate multiple files at once.
3. **Propagation:** CloudFront then propagates the invalidation request to all its edge locations worldwide. The specified content is removed from the cache at each edge location.

### Unicast IP vs Anycast IP
- **Unicast IP:** one server holds one IP
- **Anycast IP:** all server holds one IP, the client is routed to the nearest one

### Global Accelerator
- Use case : an application and have global users who want to access it directly, but it will have a lot of latency
- 2 Anycast IP are created for application,  the Anycast IP send traffic directly to Edge Location
- works with Elastic IP, EC2, ALB, NLB, public or private
- Health check, good Performance, security

### Key Differences Between CloudFront and Global Accelerator

| Feature/Aspect                  | CloudFront                                        | Global Accelerator                                 |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Content Delivery vs. Network Performance** | Focused on delivering and caching content closer to users | Focused on improving the performance and availability of entire applications by optimizing network routing |
| **Caching**                     | Caches content at edge locations                 | Does not cache content; optimizes the routing of network traffic to the best performing endpoints |
| **Use with Dynamic Content**    | Can accelerate dynamic content delivery by caching parts of the response | Better suited for applications where you need to optimize network paths to reduce latency or distribute traffic between regions |
| **Traffic Control**             | Primarily manages how and where content is cached and delivered | Allows you to manage traffic across multiple AWS regions and endpoints, making it ideal for global failover and traffic shaping |


### Security Features of CloudFront and Global Accelerator

| Security Feature               | CloudFront                                        | Global Accelerator                                |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **DDoS Protection**            | - Integrated with AWS Shield for DDoS protection <br> - AWS Shield Standard included; Shield Advanced available for extra protection | - Integrated with AWS Shield for DDoS protection <br> - AWS Shield Standard included; Shield Advanced available for extra protection |
| **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** | - AWS WAF can be deployed with CloudFront to protect against common web exploits <br> - Customizable rules to filter out malicious traffic | Not applicable; Global Accelerator does not support AWS WAF directly |
| **Encryption**                 | - Supports SSL/TLS encryption <br> - Enforces HTTPS <br> - Supports AWS KMS for encryption of sensitive data | - Global Accelerator does not handle encryption directly but can work with endpoints that enforce encryption |
| **Access Control**             | - Origin Access Control (OAC) for securing S3 access <br> - Signed URLs and Cookies for fine-grained access control | - Provides two static IP addresses to minimize attack surface <br> - Integration with IAM for secure resource management |
| **Endpoint Health Monitoring** | Not applicable; CloudFront focuses on content delivery | - Continuously monitors endpoint health <br> - Automatically redirects traffic to healthy endpoints |
| **Traffic Control**            | - Primarily manages content delivery, caching, and access control | - Allows traffic distribution across multiple AWS regions <br> -
