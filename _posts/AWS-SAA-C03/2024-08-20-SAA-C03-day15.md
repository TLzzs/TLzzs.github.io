## CloudWatch

### CloudWatch Metric
- Provides metric for every service in AWS
- **Metric** is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn...)
- Metrics belong to **namespaces**
- Dimension is an **attribute** of a metric (instance id, environment, etc...). ( Up to 30 dimensions per metric)
- Can create CloudWatch **Custom Metrics** (for the RAM for example)

### CloudWatch Metric Streams
- Continually stream CloudWatch metrics to a destination of your choice, 
- using Kinesis Data Fire hose following by destination
- 3rd party service provider

### Cloudwatch Logs
- **Log groups:** arbitrary name, usually representing an application
- **Log stream:** instances within application / log files / containers
- Can define log expiration policies (never expire, 1 day to 10 years...)
- **CloudWatch Logs can send logs to:**
  - Amazon S3 : (Export) Can take up to 12 hours (API: `CreateExportTask`)
  - Kinesis Data Streams / Kinesis Data Firehose / AWS Lambda : Realtime/ near RealTime (via **Log Subscription**)
  - OpenSearch
- Logs are encrypted by default
- Can setup KMS-based encryption with your own keys
- can doings search query on the logs

### CloudWatch Logs Aggregation Multi-Account & Multi Region


### Cloudwatch Logs for EC2
- By default, no logs from your EC2 will go to cloudwatch
- Need to run a CloudWatch Agent on EC2 to push the log files
- Need have **IAM permission** to send logs

### Logs Agent(old) & Unified Agent
- **Logs Agent :** can only send to cloudwatch logs
- **Unified Agent:** collect additional system-level metric such as RAM, processes
- centralised configuration using SSM Parameter Store

### CloudWatch Alarm
- Alarm State: OK, Insufficient_Data, Alarm
- Alarm 3 main target:
  1. Stop,Terminate, Reboot, or Recover an EC2 Instance
  2. Trigger Auto Scaling Action
  3. Send notification to SNS (from which you can do pretty much anything)

### CloudWatch Composite Alarms
- CloudWatch Alarms are on a single metric
- Composite Alarms are monitoring the states of multiple other alarms 
- **AND** and **OR** conditions

## Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Event)
### Overview
- Schedule: Cron jobs (Trigger Lambda Function every hour)
- Event Pattern: Event Rules to react to a service doing something (User login -> SNS Email Notification)
- Trigger Lambda function send SQS SNS message
-  can use for AWS Services, Partner APP, Custom APP

### Sample Use Case


### EventBridge - Schema Registry
- EventBridge can analyze the events in your bus and infer the schema
- The Schema Registry allows you to generate code for your application, that will know in advance how data is structured in the event bus


### Event Bridge - Resource-based Policy
- E.g: allow /deny events from another AWS account or Region
- Use case: aggregate all events from AWS organization in a single AWS account


--- 

### Cloudwatch Container Insight
- Collect, aggregate, summarize metrics and logs from containers
- Available for containers on...
  - Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
  - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services (Amazon EKS) 
  - Kubernetes platforms on EC2
  - Fargate (both for ECS and EKS)

### CloudWatch Lambda Insights
- Collects, aggregates, and summarizes system-level metrics including CPU time, memory, disk, and network
- Collects, aggregates, and summarizes diagnostic information such as cold starts and Lambda worker shutdowns

### CloudWatch Contributor Insights
- Analyze log data and create time series that display contributor data.
  - See metrics about the top-N contributors
  - The total number of unique contributors,and their usage.
- This helps you find top talkers and understand who or what is impacting system performance.

### CloudWatch Application Insights
- Provides automated dashboards that show potential problems with monitored applications, to help isolate ongoing issues
- Enhanced visibility into your application health to reduce the time it will take
  you to troubleshoot and repair your applications

## AWS CloudTrail

### Overview
-  Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
- CloudTrail is enabled by default!
- Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs or S3
- A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region.
- can use to track SDK, CLI, Console, service
- Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail

### CloudTrail Insight
-  Enable CloudTrail Insights to detect unusual activity
-  And then continuously analyzes write events to detect unusual patterns 
   - Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console
   - Event is sent to Amazon S3
   - An EventBridge event is generated (for automation needs)

---

## AWS Config

### Overview
- Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources
- AWS Config is a per-region service
- Can be aggregated across regions and accounts
- Possibility of storing the configuration data into S3 (analyzed by Athena)

### Questions that can be solved by AWS Config:
- Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
- Do my buckets have any public access?
- How has my ALB configuration changed over time?

### Config Rules
- Can use AWS managed config rules (over 75)
- Can make custom config rules (**must be defined in AWS Lambda**)
- AWS Config Rules does not prevent actions from happening (no deny)

### Config Remediations
- help you to perform actions once detect some unusual configuration

### Config Notifications
- Use EventBridge to trigger notifications when AWS resources are non- compliant
- Ability to send configuration changes and compliance state notifications to SNS
