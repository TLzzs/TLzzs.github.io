## ECS

### Launch Type
- **EC2 Launch Type:**
  - You must provision & maintain the infra (EC2 instances)
  - Each EC2 instance must run the ECS Agent to register in the ECS Cluster
  - AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers
- **Fargate Launch Type:**
  - You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage)
  - You just create task definitions
  - To scale, just increase the number of tasks. Simple
  - AWS just runs ECSTasks for you based on the CPU / RAM you need

### IAM Role for ECS
- EC2 Instance Profile (EC2 Launch Type only) - will be **used by ECS agent** in EC2
  - Makes API calls to ECS service
  - Send Container logs to the cloudwatch logs
  - Can Pull Docker Image from ECR
  - Reference SSM or Secret Manager
- ECS Task Role:
  - Allows each task(container) to have a specific role (target to different AWS services)
  - Task Role is defined in the task definition (will not inherit from instance profile)

### Load Balancer Integration (container level)
- Application Load Balancer: supported and works for most use cases
- Network Load Balancer: recommended only for high throughput/high performance use cases or pair it with AWS private Link

### ECS Data Volume(EFS)
- Can Mount EFS file system onto ECS tasks
- work for both **EC2** and **Fargate** launch type
- S3 can not be mounted as a file system


### Service
- Service: Manages tasks that are all instances of the same task definition (can across different EC2)
- Auto Scaling: using **AWS Application Auto Scaling** based on metric
  - metric - CPU Utilization
  - metric - Memory Utilization
  - metric - ALB Request Count Per Target
- **Target Tracking:** scale based on target value for a specific CloudWatch metric
- **Step Scaling:**  scale based on a specified CloudWatch Alarm
- **Scheduled Scaling:**  scale based on a specified date/time (predictable changes)
- task level scale != EC2 AUto Scaling
- if you want to autoscale EC2 (ASG, ECS Cluster Capacity Provider)


### ECS tasks Integration Architecture
- ECS tasks invoked by Event Bridge

- ECS tasks invoked by Event Bridge Schedule

- ECS Intercept Stopped Tasks using EventBridge

## EKS

### Overview
- launch managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS
- EKS supports EC2 or Fargate as worker node type
- Easy to migrate to other platform
- For multiple regions, deploy one EKS cluster per region

### EKS Node Type
- Managed Node Groups
  - creates and manages Nodes(EC2)for you
  - Node are part of ASH managed by EKS
  - supports on demand and spot instance

- Self Managed Nodes
  - Node created by you and registered to EKS cluster and managed by ASG
  - can use AMI
  - supports on demand and spot instance

- AWS Fargate
  - No maintenance required: no nodes managed

## AWS App Runner

- Fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy web applications and APIs at scale
- No infrastructure experience required, Start with your source code or container image
- Automatically builds and deploy the web app
- **Use cases:** web apps, APIs, microservices, rapid production deployments
