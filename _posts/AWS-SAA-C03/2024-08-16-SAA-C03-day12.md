### ECS
- Launch Docker container on AWS = Launch **ECS Tasks** On ECS Clusters
- ECS Launch Type
  - EC2 Launch Type : you must provision & maintain the infra (EC2 instances)
  - each EC2 instance must run the ECS Agent to register in the ECS Cluster
- Fargate Launch Type: don't have to manage any EC2 instances(serverless). AWS manages the infrastructure, and you only need to define your task and service configurations.

#### IAM Role for ECS
- For EC2 Launch Type:
  - the EC2 Instance Profile will be used by ECS agent to make API call to ECS service
  - Also can send Container logs to the cloudwatch logs
  - Can Pll Docker IMage from ECR
  - Reference SSM or Secret Manager
- ECS Task Role:
  - Allows each task to have a specific role (target to different AWS services)

#### Load Balancer Integration
- Application Load Balancer: supported and works for most use cases
- Network Load Balancer: recommended only for high throughput/high performance use cases or pair it with AWS private Link

#### Volume Mount (EFS)
- Can Mount EFS file system onto ECS tasks
- work for both EC2 and Farget launch type
- S3 can not be mounted as a file system


#### Service
- Service: Manages tasks that are all instances of the same task definition.
- AUto Scaling: auto increase/decrease the desired number of ECS tasks
  - metric - CPU Utilization
  - metric - Memory Utilization
  - metric - ALB Request Count Per Target
- task level scale != EC2 AUto Scaling
- if you want to autoscale EC2 (ASG, ECS Cluster Capacity Provider)
