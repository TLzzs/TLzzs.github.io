## Snow Family
### Overview
High-secure, portable device to collect and process data at edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS
- **offline devices** to perform data migrations (E.g upload to S3)
- **Snowcone:** 8 - 14 TB
  - AWS Snowcone can run edge computing workloads locally using lambda
- **Snowball Edge:** 80 - 210TB
  - Snowball Edge devices can run AWS Lambda functions, EC2 instances, and AWS IoT Greengrass, making them suitable 
    for more complex edge computing tasks.
- **Snowball to Glacier:** must use S3 first, then create a lifecycle policy transfer to Glacier

## Amazon Fsx

### Overview
Launch 3rd party high-performance file system on AWS

- **FSx for Luster** 
  - HPC, ML, Modeling, 
  - seamless integration with S3: the files in your S3 bucket can be automatically presented as files in your FSx for Lustre file system.
  - Can be used from on-premises servers (VPN or Direct Connect)
- **FSx for NetApp ONTAP**
  - File System compatible with NFS, SMB, iSCSI protocol
  - support ecs eks...
  - Point-in-time instantaneous cloning
- **FSx for Windows File Server** 
  - can mount on Linux EC2 instances
  - Supports Microsoft's Distributed File System (DFS) Namespaces
  - Can be accessed from your on-premises infrastructure (VPN or Direct Connect)
- **FSx for openZFS**
  - File System compatible with NFS (v3, v4, v4.1, v4.2)
  - support ecs eks...
  - snapshots, compression and low-cost
  - Point-in-time instantaneous cloning


### Fsx Luster - File System Deployment Options
- Persistent File System:
  1. Think of this as a long-term storage option. It keeps your data safe even if you restart the system. Good for tasks that take a long time or need data saved permanently.
  2. Supports automated and manual backups, so you can always restore your data if something goes wrong.
- Scratch File System:
  1. This is like temporary storage. It’s fast and great for short tasks, but the data doesn’t stick around after the system is turned off. Use it when you just need quick, temporary storage.
  2. Doesn’t support automated backups because it’s for temporary data. You use it for quick, short-lived tasks.

## Storage Gateway (Hybrid Cloud for Storage)

### Overview
- Bridge between on prem and cloud (S3, Fsx ..)
- Use case : DR, Backup, on-prem cache
- **IAM role for each File Gateway is necessary**

### Type of Storage Gateway
1. **S3 File Gateway**
   - Files stored on the S3 File Gateway are stored as objects in Amazon S3.
   - Files uploaded via the S3 File Gateway can be accessed directly through the S3 console, API, or SDK, just like any other S3 object.
   - Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway.
   - Transition to S3 Glacier using a Lifecycle Policy
   - Data written to the gateway is stored locally first and then asynchronously uploaded to S3,
2. **FSx File Gateway**
   - Local cache for frequently accessed data
   - When you make changes to files, those changes are saved locally first and then sent to the cloud, saving bandwidth and improving performance.
3. **Volume Gateway**
   - upload to S3 -> EBS
   - Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premises volumes
   - entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3
4. **Tape Gateway**

## AWS Transfer Family
a fully managed AWS service that enables you to securely transfer files over commonly used protocols like SFTP 
(Secure File Transfer Protocol), FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure), and FTP (File Transfer Protocol). This service allows you to easily move data into and out of **Amazon S3 or EFS** without needing to manage your own file transfer infrastructure.

## Data Sync
AWS DataSync is a service that helps you move large amounts of data quickly and securely between your on-premises storage (like your office servers) and the AWS cloud.

1. **Fast Data Transfer**:
  - DataSync is much faster than traditional methods for moving data. It’s designed to speed up the process of getting your files into the cloud.

2. **Supports Different Storage Types**:
  - You can use DataSync to move data between:
    - **Your local servers** (using NFS or SMB file systems).
    - on prem
    - **Amazon S3**: A cloud storage service for storing files. (**any type include glacier**)
    - **Amazon EFS**: A cloud-based file storage that grows with your needs.
    - **Amazon FSx**: A service for managing Windows file servers in the cloud.

3. **Automated Transfers**:
  - You can schedule DataSync to automatically move your data at regular intervals. This is great for keeping your cloud storage up to date or for backing up your files.

## Storage Gateway vs Transfer Family vs DataSync
| Feature/Service         | AWS Storage Gateway                              | AWS Transfer Family                              | AWS DataSync                                     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Function**    | Acts as a bridge between on-premises storage and AWS cloud, extending local storage into the cloud | Uses FTP protocols (SFTP, FTPS, FTP) to securely transfer files between on-premises systems and AWS (S3 or EFS) | High-speed data transfer service for migrating or backing up large amounts of data between on-premises and AWS or between AWS storage services |
| **Use Case**            | Seamlessly integrate on-premises storage with AWS without changing existing applications | Securely transfer files using standard FTP protocols, ideal for legacy systems and business partner exchanges | Fast and scalable data transfers, ideal for large-scale data migrations or backups |
| **Target Storage**      | Extends local storage to AWS cloud storage       | Transfers files to Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS       | Transfers data between on-premises storage, Amazon S3, EFS, and other AWS storage services |
| **Integration**         | Works with existing on-premises storage infrastructure | Integrates with legacy systems and supports file exchange protocols | Automates and scales data transfer between on-premises and AWS or within AWS services |
